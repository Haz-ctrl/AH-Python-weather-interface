#AH Computing project weather class
#Hashim Iqbal

#This file contains two SDD AH constructs, Object-oriented programming and Bubble sorts
#SDD also integrates with Database Design and Development here, through the databaseConnection() method.

#This class will be imported into the main script, which handles UI and other 'front-end' processes.
#This class acts as the 'back-end' of the application, providing validation, requests and database connection.
'''
Dependencies:
    Requests to handle fetch requests to the API.
    Date from Datetime to get today's date
    Dataclass from Dataclasses so that the record structure and array of records can be implemented.
    mySQL connector to establish connection with the database, and run the INSERT query.
    We will also need to pass information from the main script to this one, back and forth.
