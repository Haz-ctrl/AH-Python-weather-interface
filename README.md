# AH-Python-weather-interface

This was submitted as coursework for my Advanced Higher Computing Science class in 2021. It is a Python GUI application made using Tkinter that fetches weather information.

The use of the app is fairly simple. By running `python3 main.py`, the app will open. There are two features available:

## Fetch weather for a city
By clicking this button, you are presented with an input box to put the name of a city in, and the app will fetch weather and location information for that particular city. Afterwards, it will give the user the option to save that information to a .txt file.

## Database connection
Assuming the project database server is running, this button will populate the database table with the weather information of the top 100 countries in terms of population.
